GENERAL PERFORMANCE IMPORVEMENTS
So, super big problem. The query from crest actually returns something like 500 days of data for price history. At the moment I just drop all of them and repopulate the table with all the new order history. At the current moment, that ends up being roughly ~2.7 million rows. Since the plan is to run this ever 4 or so hours to keep the data kinda up to date I think the best thing to do would grab the last date form the column, and just get the data points missing. Not entirely sure how to do that. 

SECURITY ISSUES
Postgres's user (awbriggs) is set with a superuser and no password since I have that set as a local machines. I've never dealt with deploying before, so it will have to be investigated for what's best practice.

FEATURES
Switch to ESI endpoints for data. 
Add Support for data for more than one region.
Docket? Not something I've messed with, but it might make it a little easier to work with this.
